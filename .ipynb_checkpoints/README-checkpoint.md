# HI_Classification
This contains all my codes, data used for classifying HI absorption spectra using Machine Learning

Pre-requirements in running these codes - 

Scipy, numpy, glob, matplotlib, tensorflow, ...etc (Basic Packages)

It is required to use any busy function fitting software. I have used busyfit by Tobias Westmeier (Westmeier et al. 2014, MNRAS, 438, 1176). All my bash scripts for fitting is based on his software. If you like to use the same, download the software from his website(https://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/Tobias.Westmeier/tools_software_busyfit.php)



Thanks for having an interest, please do inform if you notice any mistakes or something.
