abstract = "HI 21-cm absorption spectroscopy provides an excellent probe of the neutral gas content of absorbing galaxies, yielding information on their kinematics, mass, physical size and ISM conditions. The high sensitivity, unrivaled frequency coverage and RFI suppression techniques of the SKA will enable it to use HI absorption to study the ISM of high column density intervening systems along thousands of lines of sight out to high redshifts. Blind SKA 21-cm surveys will yield large, unbiased absorber samples, tracing the evolution of normal galaxies and active galactic nuclei from z≳6 to the present epoch. It will thus be possible to directly measure the physical size and mass of typical galaxies as a function of redshift and, hence, to test hierarchical models of structure formation."

    abstract = "{We present the results of a systematic Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) survey of 21-cm absorption in a representative and unbiased sample of 35 strong Mg ii systems in the redshift range: zabs∼ 1.10–1.45, 33 of which have Wr≥ 1 Å. The survey using ∼400 h of telescope time has resulted in nine new 21-cm detections and stringent 21-cm optical depth upper limits (median 3σ optical depth per 10 km s−1 of 0.017) for the remaining 26 systems. This is by far the largest number of 21-cm detections from any single survey of intervening absorbers. Prior to our survey, no intervening 21-cm system was known in the above redshift range, and only one system was known in the redshift range 0.7 ≤z≤ 1.5. We discuss the relation between the detectability of 21-cm absorption and various properties of UV absorption lines. We show that if Mg ii systems are selected with the following criteria, Mg ii doublet ratio ≤1.3 and Wr(Mg i)/Wr(Mg ii) ≥ 0.3, then a detection rate of 21-cm absorption up to 90 per cent can be achieved. We estimate n21, the number per unit redshift of 21-cm absorbers with Wr(Mg ii) \\&gt;Wo and integrated optical depth , and show that n21 decreases with increasing redshift. In particular, for Wo= 1.0 Å and  falls by a factor of 4 from 〈z〉= 0.5 to 〈z〉= 1.3. The evolution seems to be stronger for stronger Mg ii systems. Using a subsample of systems for which high-frequency Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) images are available, we show that the effect is not related to the structure of the background radio sources and is most probably due to the evolution of the cold neutral medium filling factor in Mg ii systems. We find no correlation between the velocity spread of the 21-cm absorption feature and Wr(Mg ii) at z∼ 1.3.}",
